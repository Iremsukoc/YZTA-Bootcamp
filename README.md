## Project Objective

The main objective of this project is to enable individuals who are concerned about their health to perform an early-stage evaluation and to support their process of consulting healthcare professionals.  
To achieve this, two customized language model configurations and advanced image processing technologies are used together, aiming to help users assess their situation more reliably.

---

## Project Overview

Users visit the web platform and provide a brief description of their health complaint. The system then proceeds through three stages:

1. **General Assessment:**  
   The system interacts conversationally with the user, asking general follow-up questions (e.g., age, lifestyle) to identify the most likely related cancer type.

2. **Detailed Analysis:**  
   The system asks targeted, cancer-specific questions to gather more detailed information, which it analyzes for a deeper evaluation.

3. **Image Processing:**  
   If the user uploads medical images, these images are analyzed using specialized models for various cancer types, and the system provides informative feedback.

---

## Product Features

- **Short Text-Based Initial Assessment:**  
  Users enter a brief description of their health concerns. The system uses natural language processing to analyze the input and then continues by asking general follow-up questions (e.g., age, lifestyle) to gather additional information and suggest the most likely related cancer type.

- **Conversational Cancer-Specific Inquiry:**  
  Following the initial assessment, the system engages users with detailed, relevant questions specific to the identified cancer type, analyzing responses to produce comprehensive evaluations.

- **Medical Image Upload and Analysis:**  
  Users can upload medical images (e.g., MRI, X-ray), which are processed with specialized image analysis models to provide diagnostic feedback.
ied cancer type.  
  The system then provides informative feedback based on the analysis results.

<details><summary><strong style="font-size:1.2em">Estimated Completion Points</strong></summary>
**67 points**
</details>

---

<details><summary><strong style="font-size:1.2em">Estimation Logic</strong></summary>
Sprint task estimation was based on **hour-based workload** estimates using the following methodology:

| **Estimated Time** | **Story Points** |
|:------------------:|:----------------:|
| 1 day (8 hours) | 4 |
| Half day (4 hours) | 2 |
| 2 hours | 1 |
| 1 hour and below | 0.5 |

Due to team members' various responsibilities such as internships and work commitments, weekday working hours were expected to be more limited while weekends would be more intensive. Therefore, task time estimates and point allocation were planned considering this balance:

- **Weekdays:** Typically 1-2 hour work blocks were planned
- **Weekends:** Longer focused work sessions (4-5 hours) were targeted

Consequently, task time estimates and point allocation were prepared considering this balance, and the sprint target was set at **67 points** total.

<details><summary><strong style="font-size:1.2em">Daily Scrum</strong></summary>

Initially, WhatsApp was used for Daily Scrum notifications and tracking. However, to ensure a more organized and manageable process, we transitioned to using Google Forms. The final form (shown below) was created, and reminder messages were sent via WhatsApp to each team member to complete the form daily.

Responses submitted through the form are automatically collected and stored in a Google Sheet, providing a centralized and easily accessible record. This approach has made daily progress tracking more transparent and systematic.

### What Went Well

- All team members attended meetings consistently and maintained effective, transparent communication regarding ongoing work.
- Team members eagerly took on their tasks and responsibilities, completing them on time and with diligence.
- Issues encountered were openly raised and constructively discussed, leading to actionable solutions.
- The frontend development progressed faster than planned, enabling early achievement of sprint goals.
- In the LLM (Large Language Model) area, not only were prompts developed for general testing, but successful trials of more advanced prompts for the second phase were also initiated.
- The backend infrastructure was set up and connected on schedule.
- Leveraging the Kaggle platform and research by a dedicated team member, ready-made machine learning models for breast cancer were identified. These models are currently in the process of being run locally, which has accelerated progress on the ML side.

### What Went Badly

- No final decision has yet been made regarding the project name and logo; this issue needs to be prioritized and addressed promptly.
- The product scope was not fully defined at the outset, resulting in frequent scope changes during development; this particularly affected task and design revisions in the frontend and machine learning areas.
- There is hesitation in submitting code reviews (CR), and the review process duration is long, causing pull requests (PRs) to remain open for extended periods.

### Areas for Improvement

- Finalize product scope before sprint start to minimize mid-sprint changes. 
- Enhance frontend testing and prepare detailed test documentation including manual test steps. 
- Implement a regular notification system through communication channels to encourage timely code review submissions and reduce PR open times. 

### Next Sprint Tasks

- Prioritize selection of project name and logo to establish brand identity.
- Complete UI, backend, LLM, and ML integration and conduct thorough testing. 
- Develop prompts specifically targeting the detailed analysis phase of the LLM module. 
- Run image classification model locally for an additional selected cancer type.
